lets continue working on this project, we have this pseudo plan docs/IFINALLYILL_PREPLAN_ANALYSIS.md and we have this docs/V6_EXTRACTION.md and the Willsystem code that we need to port is      
  /home/abrahaam/Documents/GitHub/Willsystem-v6 we need to know were we are standing, since is a port, we are reusing all components (cleaning them and porting them clean status) and logic       
  (also extracting it clean since for instance js/utils/* has a lot of functions on separated files which need to be properly cleaned and whatnot, important files to review are the utils,        
  Personal.jsx  all the steps components, what inputs they collect to be used with the function that with the templates renders each document on PDFEditor.jsx , the landing, register and         
  personal.jsx dashboard is gonna be cloned as is , properly ported and then we are gonna clone all each step individual components, we need to modify them to send the same inputs they are       
  collecting right now but properly implemented on the new platform... read the dos preplan and extraction, this is the clean status of the platform visualkit core clean:                         
  9add13bbef4df1cf1ef7e844ed8fa64e05dbbe0f and here 05fb9193f6d587a91ed682ddafc5e25a3b50a600 is the first iteration porting willsystem/ifinallywill to the platform core , please understand what  
  we are trying to do here since we have only two weeks to port this properly, we have been working on this with this very same prompt and we got some commits on the process which we havent      
  sent push because the commits are dirty, we need to uncommit, and create a well documented commit and whatnot and continue with the pending work, all of this on this section, we need to work smart, we have all components, logic and workflows, controllers, middleware, routes, database, seeders, commands and whatnot, we just need to port everything to a perfect implementation, this shouldnt neither be hard or take too long since everything is already built and we are extracting to create a minimal version of the system, personal.jsx on the Willsystem-v6 folder has the /home/abrahaam/Documents/GitHub/Willsystem-v6/resources/js/Pages/Will/Personal.jsx has the core of the platform, the imports give us a full picture of the whole system since all currently is being done by that component, we need to extract landing page, register wizard and personal.jsx workflow to create documents using all the steps components like Pets, Wipeout, Additional etc, but the idea is that we are building properly
