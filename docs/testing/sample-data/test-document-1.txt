Platform Documentation

Introduction
This is a test document for the Knowledge Base Upload feature. It demonstrates the document chunking and embedding generation process using Voyage Multimodal-3 embeddings.

Features
The platform supports multi-modal AI interactions with real-time communication. Users can upload documents to enhance the AI's knowledge base through RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation).

Architecture
The system uses a microservices architecture with separate API and WebSocket servers. The database layer uses PostgreSQL with pgvector extension for efficient vector similarity search.

Performance
The chunking algorithm splits documents into 800-character chunks with 100-character overlap. This ensures semantic coherence while optimizing for embedding quality.

Conclusion
This test document validates the end-to-end upload flow from file selection through chunking, embedding generation, and database storage.
